# Forge

A collection of stubs I use a lot in the process of development. Trying to move these to git, cleaning them up.

Things like:
* bash scripts
* handy commands
* k8s manifest stubs
* docker utils
* make shortcuts
* python samples

Things like this but not here:
* https://github.com/tolson-vkn/env-echgo
    * A simple flask app in K8s to let the user see how K8s works. (Kind of like KUARD)
